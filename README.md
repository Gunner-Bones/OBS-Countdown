# OBS-Countdown
It's literally a countdown timer lol

## Installation
This requires Python 3.7 or higher.
Make sure you also have the Python module `psutil`.
To install it, open a **Command Prompt** and type:
```
pip install psutil
```

To run the program, simply run `main.py` with the command:
```
python3 main.py
```

## Usage
Replace the "HH:MM:SS" text with a specified time in that format,
and press Start. 

## OBS Setup
Make sure OBS or OBS Studio is open, along with the OBS Countdown timer.
In OBS, go to the **Sources** box and click the + sign. From the
dropdown, select **Window Capture**. Give the capture a name.
In the **Window** dropdown, choose "\[obs_countdown.exe]: Countdown Timer".
The timer will then display on your screen.
*Note*: The timer will not update if it is minimized, however it will
continue to update on OBS even if other windows are covering the timer. 
To crop the timer window on the OBS capturing window, hold the Alt key
when dragging on the timer's window borders.
